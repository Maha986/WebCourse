                <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                    morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
                    discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators,
                    however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                    settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                    considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                <p>In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                    philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours
                    like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who
                    would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have
                    continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era</p>

                <p>Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed
                    necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                    imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                    cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                    imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom.[2]

                    Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3]</p>
